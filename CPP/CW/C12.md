**Define encapsulation and explain how it is implemented in C++.**

-   The wrapping up of data and functions (that operate on the data) into
    one single unit (called class) is called encapsulation.
-   It is implemented by using classes in C++.
-   In a cass:

    -   Data Members : Physical Characteristics
    -   Member Functions: Behaviour

-   ###### Example of a class:

    ```cpp
    class sample {
        int a, b;              // Data Members

        public:
        void read() {          // Member Function
            a = 1;
            b = 5;
        }
        void show() {          // Member Function
            cout << a + b;
        }
    };
    ```

**Define data abstraction and hiding.**

-   The act of representing only the essential features without
    including the background details is called data abstraction.
-   This concept is implemented using `public` access level specifier
    in a class.
-   The public members are directly accessible outside the class
    using an object of the class.
-   The private and the protected members of the class are not directly
    accessible from outside the class.
-   They are hidden from the outside world.
-   Hence, they implement the concept of data hiding.

-   ###### Example:

    ```cpp
    class Sample {
        int a, b;              // Data Members

        public:
        void read() {          // Member Function
            a = 1;
            b = 5;
        }
        void show() {          // Member Function
            cout << a + b;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Sample S;
        S.a = 5;      // S1 - Invalid as a is a private member
        S.b = 10;     // S2 - Invalid as b is a private member
        S.read();     // S3 - valid
        S.show();     // S4 - valid
    }

    // Assuming S1 and S2 are edicated, output will be 6.
    ```

        <tr>
            <td>Public member functions are invoked using an object with a

            <td>No such restrictions.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>The member functions can access private, protected and public
                members of the class.</td>
            <td>Can directly access only public members of the class.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Member functions are inline by default.</td>
            <td>Non inline by default.</td>
        </tr>

###### Note:

-   Member functions declared inside a class are inline by default.
-   Object -> structure variable / class variable.
-   When we define a class memory won't be allocated for data members.
-   Member functions statements will be stored in global memory.
-   Class / Structure variables are known as instances / objects.
-   The private and protected members of a global / local object are
    directly accessible inside the member function of the class.
-   The only difference between classes and structures w.r.t C++ is
    about the access level specifiers.
-   Structure will have only data members and class will have data
    members and member functions.
-   In structure, everything is public and accessible and vice-versa,
    in classes it is private by default.
