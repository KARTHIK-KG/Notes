### What is NodeJS?

-   NodeJS or Node is an open source and cross platform **runtime environment**
    for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.
-   We often use Node to build backend services like APIs.
-   Node is ideal for building higly-scalable, data-intensive and real time
    apps.
-   Node is not a programming language.
-   NodeJS is asyncrhonous by default.
-   Node is ideal for **I/O-intensive** apps.
-   Do not use Node for **CPU-intesive** apps.
-   Examples of CPU-intesisve: Video-Encoding, Image Manipulation Service.

### Why NodeJS?

-   NodeJS allows us to create backend using JavaScript.
-   If you already know JS then for backend you need not learn yet another
    language and all of it intricacies.
-   Node is also superfast and will allow us to create really scalable and
    fast running websites.
-   Companies that use NodeJS: Twitter, Netflix, Trello, Uber
-   Node is great for prototyping and agile development.
-   Since we use JS in frontend and backend, source code will be cleaner and
    more consistent.
-   Largest ecosystem of open-sourced libraries.
